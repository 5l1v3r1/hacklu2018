Setup your phone to connect to the base station

Settings -> Mobile Networks -> Network Operators ->Search Networks

Wait till you see your base station on the scanned networks. Click on the base station and connect to it. 

Add a dummy APN value to your phone. There simply needs to be some value. 
Any random value works. Just that there should be a dummy value. 

Settings-> Mobile Networks ->Access Point Name-> New (+)
